# Linux Sys Admin - Field Structure

This note type stores Linux system administration concepts and definitions.

## Fields

1. **Concept** - The term or concept prompt (e.g., `Login Shell`)
2. **Meaning** - The definition or explanation to recall

## Format

Each note follows the pipe-delimited format:
```
Concept|Meaning
```

## Notes

- Keep fields in this exact order: `Concept|Meaning`
- Keep each note on one line for reliable import
- If you want line-break-like readability in the source, separate clauses with `;`
    - Have no space to the next line and do proper capitalization (unless starting with code or case-sensitive word)
