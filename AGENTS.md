# Instructions

- Avoid using single or double quote characters (`'` or `"`)
    - If quote character is necessary, use `<single-quote>` or `<double-quote>` instead
- When adding new notes, make sure to read the appropriate `fields.md` and `cards.md` for that note type (it goes on directory structure)
